			<p>The recipes Lilly has created or modified have a history of their own. Originally, she was just taking
			   recipes other people had created and making them. However, often she would find the taste wasn't
			   that good. She had a thought to start modifying recipes.</p>
			<p>First, she started with bariatric-safe recipes, modifying them to taste good, as good or better than 
			   normal foods. Then she moved to the more complex step: taking normal food recipes and modifying/
			   substituting for bariatric-safe ingredients.</p>
			<p>Her list of recipes is quite lengthy, most of which you cannot tell the difference between the modified
			   and original foods.</p>
