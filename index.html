			<p>Welcome! This website is for bariatric patients, their families/friends, and seekers of healthy food
			   or weight loss alike. In these pages, you will find recipes that are made for those who have had
			   bariatric surgery. This doesn't mean, though, that other people cannot enjoy them as well.</p>

			<p>Some recipes in this website are adapted for the bariatric diet, others have no normal counterpart.
			   All recipes have been perfected by Lilly Williams, the owner and chef of Mommy Business. With
			   the help of her family, she has made perfect or better bariatric counterparts to normal foods like
			   biscuits and gravy or pizza. Don't be afraid to live and eat like a normal person again.</p>
