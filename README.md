Mommy Business Restaurant is a small business started by my mother, Lilly Williams. She takes ordinary meals your mother or grandmother would make, and a few abstract ones, and crafts them to be extremely health. Most meals are low- or no-carb, low- or no-sugar, and more. All meals that are made by Mommy Business are bariatric friendly, as she is a bariatric patient herself. She has even managed to get people to try things they would absolutely oppose.
