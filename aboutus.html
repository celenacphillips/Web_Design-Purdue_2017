			<p>Lilly Williams is the founder of Mommy Business. The road to Mommy Business initially began
			   when she was a young adult. She gained a lot of weight and no matter how hard she tried, no
			   matter how healthy she ate, she could not lose the weight. She was well over 300 pounds at her
			   heaviest. Even the doctors could not find any reason why she should not lose the weight.</p>

			<p>After having her four children, Lilly decided to pursue bariatric surgery. To have the surgery, she
			   had to prove she could eat and maintain her new special diet for months. The process began in 2012
			   and she had the surgery in September.</p>

			<p>In the beginning, she struggled as her body was acclimating to the new diet. Some days or even
			   months she could eat certain foods and later she found it would make her sick. It was a very long
			   process of trial and error for Lilly.</p>

			<p>In 2014 through 2015, acquaintances of Lilly started wanting her to cook for them. They, too, were
			   tired of not being able to lose weight. Their issues, however, were due to lack of education about
			   food.</p>
			<p> So Lilly in 2015 started a small business, originally named Mommy Lunches as she was only
			   making lunches for the teachers at her sons' school. Soon those teachers began losing weight and
			   demanding her make more meals for them. Thus, the Mommy Business was born, with an average of
			   $5 a meal. Lilly has even been hired to cater various events, the small and the elite.<p>

				<li>Results are guaranteed. Be that feeling better, more energetic, or losing weight.</li>
				<li>Minimal cost for great food.</li>
